1) Binary --> Decimal Conversion (2 ქულა)

Create a program which receives a binary number and converts it to decimal.
✅
Examples:
10001 --> 17
1111 --> 15


2) Decimal --> Binary Conversion (2 ქულა)

Create a program which receives a decimal number and converts it to binary.

Examples:
17 --> 10001
15 --> 1111
✅

3) Remove Duplicates from a List (3 ქულა)
Create a program that receives a list and removes duplicate elements while maintaining the original order.
Examples:
[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5] --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
['a', 'b', 'a', 'c'] --> ['a', 'b', 'c']
✅
4) Factorial Calculation (3 ქულა)
Create a program that receives a non-negative integer and returns
 its factorial. The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n. By definition, the factorial of 0 is 1.
Examples:
5 --> 120
0 --> 1
✅

5) Palindrome Checker (3 ქულა)
Create a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward). The function should ignore spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.
Examples:
"A man a plan a canal Panama" --> True
"Hello" --> False
✅

6) Convert Pascal Case string into snake_case (4 ქულა)

You will receive a string which will contain words in PascalCase, your job is to convert them into snake_case.

Examples:
"TestController"  -->  "test_controller"
"MoviesAndBooks"  -->  "movies_and_books"
"App7  Test"        -->  "app7_test"
1                 -->  "1"

7) Fibonacci Sequence Generator (4 ქულა)
Create a program that receives an integer n and returns the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
Examples:
5 --> [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
7 --> [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
✅
8) Orders (4 ქულა)

Your task is to sort a given string. Each word in the string will contain a single number. This number is the position the word should have in the result.

NOTE: Numbers can be from 1 to 9. So 1 will be the first word (not 0).

If the input string is empty, return an empty string. The words in the input String will only contain valid consecutive numbers.

Examples:
"is2 Thi1s T4est 3a"  -->  "Thi1s is2 3a T4est"
"4 of Fo1r people g3ood th5e the2"  -->  "Fo1r the2 g3ood 4 of th5e people"
""  -->  ""



9) Prime time (4 ქულა)

Write a function that takes a maximum bound and returns all primes up to and including the maximum bound.

For example:
11 => [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]



10) "Eureka" numbers (5 ქულა)

The Eureka numbers are numbers like this: 135 = 1 * 1 + 3 * 2 + 5 ** 3. Which means that we have to take a number and sum its digits raised to the consecutive powers.
First digit to power 1, second to power 2 and so on... If the result of that sum is the same as the number itself that means that number is Eureka.

Create a function which receives a range like (a, b) and outputs every Eureka number in it.

NOTE: Every number which have one digit is Eureka, because for example 5 = 5 ** 1...

Examples:
1, 10  --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
1, 100 --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 89]
